Highway jump starts your GWT on AppEngine development experience. It provides a convenient helper that integrates with popular libraries [gwt-dispatch](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dispatch/), [objectify](http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/), [gin](http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/) and [guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/).

Highway give you a secure, sensible and productivity-enhancing architecture out-of-the-box. You get:

- A secure-by-default dispatching system that uses the command pattern (based on an up-to-date snapshot of [gwt-dispatch](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dispatch/)).
- Pre-configured [guice-servlet](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/wiki/Servlets) and [gin](http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/) modules that get you started quickly.
- A client command cache that saves you round-trips to the server.
- Integration with [objectify](http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/), one of the best lightweight AppEngine Datastore wrappers.

The project is still its incubation phase: don't worry, more documentation and features are on the way. Still, have a look around, submit feedback and contribute to your heart's content! Check out the [Spirz.com repo](http://github.com/taoneill/spirz) for an example of Highway in action.

Infinite thanks to Ryan Ray for his [best's practice presentation](http://code.google.com/events/io/2009/sessions/GoogleWebToolkitBestPractices.html), to David M. Chandler for his [top notch blog posts](http://turbomanage.wordpress.com/) (on which most of the early functionality of Highway is based) and to all contributors of the [gwt-dispatch](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dispatch/) and [objectify](http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/) projects without whom none of this would be possible.
