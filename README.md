Highway jump starts your GWT on AppEngine development experience by providing you with a convenient helper that integrates with popular libraries ([gwt-dispatch](http://code.google.com/p/gwt-dispatch/), [objectify](http://code.google.com/p/objectify-appengine/), [gin](http://code.google.com/p/google-gin/) and [guice](http://code.google.com/p/google-guice/)).

With Highway, you get right down to the business of building apps and you don't have to worry about wiring up all those libraries you need to be productive.

The project is still its incubation phase, but don't hesitate to give it a spin, give feedback and contribute. Have a look at the [repo for Spirz.com](http://github.com/taoneill/spirz) for an example of how to use Highway.

Infinite thanks to Ryan Ray for his [exceptional best's practice presentation](http://code.google.com/events/io/2009/sessions/GoogleWebToolkitBestPractices.html), to David M. Chandler for his [top notch blog posts](http://turbomanage.wordpress.com/) (on which most of the early functionality is Highway is based) and to all contributors of the gwt-dispatch and objectify projects without whom none of this would have happened.
